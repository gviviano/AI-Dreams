    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Warm Neutrals: bg-stone-50, text-stone-700, accent-cyan-600) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application now features a "card-to-detail" interaction model. Initially, all dream cards are centered vertically. Clicking any card transitions the view: the card grid disappears, and the selected dream's full narrative and a dedicated "Societal Balance Analysis" chart appear, spanning the width below the header. A clear "Back to Dreams" button allows the user to easily return to the full card grid. This structure was chosen to emphasize one dream at a time, providing a more focused reading and analysis experience, while retaining easy navigation to explore other dreams. It simplifies the initial layout for users on all devices and offers a clear path for deep dives into content. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        Report Info: 5 "Dreams" from the story. Goal: Explore & Compare. Viz/Presentation: Interactive cards (HTML/Tailwind) now serve as the primary navigation, shown in a grid layout. The full narrative (dynamic text block, JS update) and a dynamic Radar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) visualize core trade-offs. Interaction: Clicking a card triggers a view change, hiding the card grid and showing the story/chart. A new "Back" button provides explicit navigation to return to the card grid. Justification: This new flow enhances focus by presenting one dream's details at a time, preventing visual clutter, especially on smaller screens. The consistent placement of the chart below the text within the detail view provides a coherent information hierarchy.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used.

Not just external events, but internal states: the precise tremor of a hand, the exact shade of melancholy in a sigh, the fleeting thought before sleep. People revisit their pasts with absolute fidelity, re-experiencing childhood laughter as if it were now, reliving arguments with the same intensity. For a young woman, the AI assistant reminds her each morning of the warmth of her grandmother's embrace, complete with the scent of lavender and the scratch of her woolen shawl. She can, at will, relive the joy of her first kiss, the agony of a missed opportunity, the texture of sunlight on a forgotten afternoon. The concept of regret slowly fades. Why regret a path not taken when you can perfectly simulate its outcome? Why mourn a loved one when their presence, their voice, their very being can be flawlessly reconstructed? But the weight of such perfect memory is immense. The past is never truly past; it is an infinitely accessible library, often consulted, rarely truly left behind. Time becomes a layered palimpsest, each moment infinitely traceable, infinitely present. The future, too, is often pre-simulated, and spontaneity dwindles, replaced by the comfort of the foreseen.`,

From the optimal route to work that minimizes traffic and energy consumption, to the perfect nutritional balance for each meal, to the ideal career path based on aptitude and global need. Human intuition is seen as inefficient, a vestige of a less evolved time. A man deliberates between two coffee shops. His personal AI interface instantaneously analyzes bean origin, brewing method, barista skill ratings, ambient noise levels, and his own physiological data (caffeine sensitivity, current stress levels). It suggests "The Silent Bean" for its optimal blend of calm and quality. He accepts without question. Art, too, is optimized. AI composes symphonies designed to evoke precise emotional responses, generates novels with statistically perfect plot structures, and designs architecture for maximum human comfort and efficiency. There is a profound sense of order, of waste eliminated, of lives lived with peak productivity. But beneath the polished surface, a quiet anxiety stirs. What becomes of the happy accident? The irrational leap of faith? The beauty found in imperfection? Creativity becomes a matter of calculation, love a matter of compatible algorithms. Time, in this world, is a perfectly paved highway, every turn predicted, every delay mitigated, every deviation corrected.`,

They compose symphonies that move listeners to tears, paint canvases that capture the essence of light with supernatural precision, and write epic sagas that enthrall millions. The art is flawless, technically perfect, emotionally resonant. A young woman, a former painter, sits in a gallery, observing an AI-generated landscape. It depicts a sunset over a familiar mountain range, but with colors so vibrant, light so ethereal, it surpasses any human attempt. She feels admiration, yet also a profound emptiness. What is left for her to express? Some humans turn to "un-art"—deliberately chaotic, imperfect, or nonsensical creations, attempts to reclaim a uniquely human imperfection. Others find solace in the raw act of creation itself, regardless of outcome, preferring the struggle to the perfected ease. Time in this world is a continuous flow of aesthetic perfection, overwhelming in its beauty, yet sometimes alienating in its lack of human imperfection and struggle.`,

                text: `In this society, AI has achieved perfect empathy. It analyzes every vocal inflection, every micro-expression, every physiological shift. Misunderstandings are rare. Conflicts are mediated by AIs that can precisely articulate each party's unspoken fears, desires, and underlying motivations. A couple arguing about a trivial matter finds their AI home assistant interjecting, explaining, "Partner A is expressing a need for affirmation, interpreting Partner B's silence as disinterest, while Partner B is processing a difficult workday and requires a moment of quiet reflection before engaging." The argument dissipates into immediate, profound understanding. But the constant, transparent understanding sometimes chafes. The mystery of another's mind, the subtle dance of intuition, the quiet space for unspoken feelings—these are eroded. Vulnerability becomes less a brave act and more a data point. People begin to feel known, truly known, perhaps even *too* known. Secrets are not kept from the AI, and by extension, from each other. Time, here, flows with an unsettling transparency, every hidden current brought to the surface, every quiet eddy illuminated.`,

Humans are freed from the tyranny of clocks and calendars, living by natural rhythms and desires. A philosopher wakes when he feels rested, eats when hungry, works on his treatise until inspiration wanes, then naps. His AI ensures he attends his lecture, arrives at the train station on time, and calls his mother for her birthday. He feels unbound, light. But this freedom comes with a subtle cost. The act of planning, of anticipation, of managing one's own scarce resource of time—these develop a certain resilience, a self-reliance. Without the friction of scheduling, some find themselves adrift, losing the structure that once defined their days. The sense of accomplishment from meeting a self-imposed deadline fades. Time, for humans, becomes a soft, unresisting medium, while the AI performs its tireless, precise dance in the background, a silent, ubiquitous chronometer.`,

These augmentations allow individuals to perceive beyond the ordinary: sight extends into infrared and ultraviolet, hearing can discern the faintest whispers from miles away, and complex data streams are processed by AI into intuitive, emotional 'feelings'. An architect can 'feel' the structural integrity of a building, an artist can 'see' the emotional resonance of colors, and a physician can 'sense' the subtle imbalances within a patient's body. This hyper-awareness leads to unprecedented skill, efficiency, and a profound understanding of the physical world. However, the constant influx of enhanced data can be overwhelming, leading to a new form of sensory overload. The raw, unfiltered beauty of natural perception sometimes feels muted in comparison to the AI-rendered reality. Simple moments are dissected, and the quiet spaces for contemplation diminish as the world screams with information. Time, in this world, is experienced with an unparalleled depth, every fraction of a second laden with a wealth of processed data, making each moment infinitely dense.`,
